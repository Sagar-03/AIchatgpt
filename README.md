**Project Title: Personal AI ChatGPT**
(Your Personalized ai chat gpt)

## Overview
Welcome to the Personal AI Chat with GPT project! This project aims to provide users with a personalized and engaging conversational experience through an AI-powered chat interface. Leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, users can interact with an intelligent chatbot capable of understanding and generating human-like responses

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: The chatbot is equipped with advanced natural language processing capabilities, allowing it to comprehend user inputs in a conversational manner.
- **Contextual Responses**: GPT maintains context throughout the conversation, enabling it to generate relevant responses based on previous interactions.
- **Personalization**: Over time, the chatbot learns from user interactions, allowing it to tailor responses to individual preferences and conversational patterns.
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Users can engage in multi-turn conversations, where the chatbot remembers past interactions and responds coherently.
- **Flexible Integration**: The project provides APIs and interfaces for seamless integration into various platforms, such as websites, mobile apps, or messaging applications.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Personal AI Chat with GPT project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sagar-03/AIchatgpt
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```
    To install dependencies for a Vite project, you typically use npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn. Here's how you can do it using npm:

3. **Navigate to your project directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.

4. **Initialize a `package.json` file (if not already present)**: If your project doesn't already have a `package.json` file, you can create one by running:

   ```
   npm init -y
   ```

   This command will create a `package.json` file with default values.

5. **Install dependencies**: Use npm to install the required dependencies. For Vite projects, common dependencies might include Vue, React, or other libraries/frameworks, along with any other project-specific dependencies. For example, to install Vue as a dependency, you would run:

   ```
   npm install vue
   ```

   Replace `vue` with the name of the package you want to install.

6. **Save dependencies to `package.json`**: By default, npm will save installed dependencies to your `package.json` file under the `dependencies` section. If you want to save a dependency as a development dependency (e.g., a testing library), you can use the `--save-dev` flag. For example:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This command installs Jest as a development dependency and adds it to the `devDependencies` section of your `package.json` file.

7. **Optional: Install Vite globally**: If you haven't already installed Vite globally, you can do so using npm:

   ```
   npm install -g vite
   ```

8. **Obtain API Key**: Obtain an API key from OpenAI to access the GPT model. You can sign up for an API key [here](https://openai.com).

9. **Configure Settings**: Update the configuration settings in `config.py` with your API key and any other required parameters.

10. **Run the Application**: Launch the application by running the main script:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

11. **Start Chatting**: Once the application is running, open a web browser and navigate to the provided URL to start chatting with the AI chatbot.
