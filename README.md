**Project Title: Personal AI Chat with GPT**

## Overview
Welcome to the Personal AI Chat with GPT project! This project aims to provide users with a personalized and engaging conversational experience through an AI-powered chat interface. Leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, users can interact with an intelligent chatbot capable of understanding and generating human-like responses.

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: The chatbot is equipped with advanced natural language processing capabilities, allowing it to comprehend user inputs in a conversational manner.
- **Contextual Responses**: GPT maintains context throughout the conversation, enabling it to generate relevant responses based on previous interactions.
- **Personalization**: Over time, the chatbot learns from user interactions, allowing it to tailor responses to individual preferences and conversational patterns.
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Users can engage in multi-turn conversations, where the chatbot remembers past interactions and responds coherently.
- **Flexible Integration**: The project provides APIs and interfaces for seamless integration into various platforms, such as websites, mobile apps, or messaging applications.
